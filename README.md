## Features

### 1. Create Items

To create a new item in the shopping list, click on the "Add Item" button. Enter the name of the item in the input field and press enter or click the "Add" button.

### 2. Edit Items

To edit an existing item, simply click on the item name in the list. This will make the item editable. Edit the item name directly in the list and press enter to save the changes.

### 3. Update Items

Items can be updated by editing their names (as described in the "Edit Items" section). Once edited, the changes will be automatically updated in the list.

### 4. Remove Items

To remove an item from the shopping list, hover over the item and click on the delete icon (usually represented as a trash can icon). Confirm the deletion if prompted.

### 5. Save Items to Browser Local Storage

All items added to the shopping list are automatically saved to the browser's local storage. This means that even if you close the browser or refresh the page, your shopping list will persist.
